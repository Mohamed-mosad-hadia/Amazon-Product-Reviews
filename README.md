# Amazon Product Reviews
Decoding Consumer Sentiment for Better Insights

# Overview

 This project uses Amazon product reviews to analyze consumer sentiment. The dataset provides a rich resource for understanding feedback on various products, including:

- Product Information: Identifiers, descriptions, and metadata

- Review Content: Text reviews, star ratings, and helpfulness votes

- Reviewer Demographics: When available, additional insights into the reviewers themselves

# Data Source

The data was downloaded from Kaggle, containing reviews in CSV format.

# Project Components

- Data Loading: Automatically mounts Google Drive and uploads Kaggle API credentials for seamless data download.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data visualization and initial insights.

- Sentiment Analysis: The main focus of the project, employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify review sentiments.

# Libraries Used
- Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis

- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing review distributions and sentiment trends

- NLTK: For text processing and sentiment analysis

# Goals

This project aims to build a model that can accurately classify Amazon reviews into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) based on the review text, contributing insights into product popularity and consumer satisfaction.
